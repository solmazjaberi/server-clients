# server-clients
This project contains a server and clients that can transmit data about cryptocurrency.
I will update this project gradually to add different features!


Steps:
1. Fundamental socket programing: There is a server and one client. In the server, a table of cryptocurrency prices is created to send this data to the client when they are connected. The data is stored as a csv file in both sides.
2.  Coming soon .. :)
